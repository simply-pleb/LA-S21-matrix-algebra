# LA S21 matrix algebra
A project that I made for my linear algebra course. This program is capable of 

- Matrix algebra and operations 
    - addition, subtraction, multiplication and comparison
    - Inverting and transposing a matrix
    - Finding the determinant of a matrix
- Finding the elimination and permutation matrices
- Applying the Jacobi's and Seidel's methods for solving $Ax=b$
- Applying the least square method to a given dataset of points

The program is now set to finding the least square approximation and requires _GNUPLOT_ to display the graph.

Currently the source needs refactoring and I honestly do not remember how it all worked. Anyway, here is an example of how the least square approximation looked
